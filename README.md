## Introduction

The Titanic Survival Prediction Project aims to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. This project includes data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset, model training using a Random Forest Classifier, evaluation of the model's performance, and generating a submission file for a Kaggle competition.
